**Total Issues:** 10 (all currently open)


## Severity Breakdown
- **Medium:** 6  
- **Low:** 4

## Final result:
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 12 06 28 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24a502b6-b387-4a46-85ce-b2027a715248" />

## Vulnerability Types
1. **Path Traversal (7 occurrences)**
   - **Cause:** Unsanitized input (from command line or environment variables) flowing into file/directory operations (`pathlib.Path`, `open()`, `json.dump()`).
   - **Risk:** Potentially allows attackers to **read or write arbitrary files**.

2. **Code Injection (1 occurrence)**
   - **Cause:** Unsanitized environment variable flows into `importlib.import_module()`.
   - **Risk:** Can enable **arbitrary code execution**.

3. **Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort (2 occurrences)**
   - **Cause:** Use of `hashlib.md5` instead of a more secure hashing algorithm.
   - **Risk:** `md5` is considered **insecure**; sensitive data is vulnerable to attack.

## Key Takeaways
- **Path Traversal**: Always **validate** or **sanitize** all external input before using it in file or directory operations.
- **Code Injection**: Strictly **sanitize environment variable input** used for dynamic module imports.
- **Insecure Hashing**: Replace `md5` with a **stronger hashing algorithm** (e.g., `SHA-256` or better).

# Step-by-Step Guide for Fixing the Reported Issues

Below is a high-level process you can follow to address each class of vulnerability identified by Snyk:

---
# repair steps:
## 1. Path Traversal

### 1.1 Identify All Insecure File Operations
- **Locate** every place in the code where external inputs are used to construct file paths (e.g., `pathlib.Path()`, `open()`, `json.dump()`).
- **Review** variables that store command-line inputs, environment variables, or user-provided data.

### 1.2 Validate or Sanitize Inputs
- **Restrict** inputs to an allowed list (whitelisting):
  - For instance, allow only certain file extensions, directories, or patterns.
- **Normalize** the path to prevent directory escape (e.g., using `os.path.normpath` or similar functions).
- **Check** if the resolved path is within a defined safe directory:
  ```python
  import os

  safe_base = '/var/app/safe_dir'
  user_input = os.path.normpath(user_input_path)

  full_path = os.path.join(safe_base, user_input)
  if not full_path.startswith(safe_base):
      raise ValueError("Invalid path: potential path traversal attempt!")

### 1.3 Use Secure APIs

- ** If possible, use libraries or frameworks that provide path-sanitization or sandboxing features.

### 1.4 Test Thoroughly

- ** Write unit tests that try to exploit path traversal (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd) to ensure your safeguards are working.


2. Code Injection
2.1 Identify Dynamic Imports

    Locate all code sections that import modules dynamically (e.g., importlib.import_module()).
    Trace where the module name string comes from (environment variables, user input, config files, etc.).

2.2 Sanitize or Restrict Inputs

    Validate the input against a list of known valid modules:

    ALLOWED_MODULES = {'module_a', 'module_b'}

    if user_input_module not in ALLOWED_MODULES:
        raise ImportError("Module not allowed!")

    Avoid using unsanitized external values directly in importlib.import_module().

2.3 Consider Safer Alternatives

    If dynamic behavior is needed, refactor your code to load only vetted modules or use a plugin framework that enforces security policies.

2.4 Test for Injection Scenarios

    Attempt passing malicious strings or environment variables to confirm your new checks block them.

3. Insecure Hashing (MD5)
3.1 Identify All MD5 Usage

    Search your codebase for hashlib.md5.
    Determine why MD5 is used (e.g., quick checksums vs. password hashing).

3.2 Replace with Stronger Algorithms

    For checksums (integrity checks), use hashlib.sha256() or a similar secure function.
    For password hashing or sensitive data storage:
        Use key-stretching algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2.
        This ensures passwords are salted and computationally expensive to crack.

3.3 Update Code Snippets

import hashlib

# Instead of:
# hash_digest = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# Use:
hash_digest = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# For passwords, prefer specialized libraries:
# import bcrypt
# hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())

3.4 Migrate Existing Data (If Needed)

    If the stored hashes are part of your system:
        Plan a migration strategy (e.g., re-hash user passwords upon next login with a modern algorithm).

Final Checklist

    Code Review & Refactoring
        Validate external inputs for file paths.
        Whitelist modules for dynamic imports.
        Replace insecure hashing algorithms.

    Secure Coding Practices
        Always sanitize user inputs (command line, environment variables, API requests).
        Avoid overly permissive patterns that allow unexpected paths or code execution.

    Testing & Verification
        Create test cases specifically targeting Path Traversal, Code Injection, and Insecure Hashing scenarios.
        Use security-focused tools (like Snyk, CodeQL, etc.) to continuously scan the codebase.

    Monitoring & Maintenance
        Keep dependencies updated (to patch known vulnerabilities).
        Re-run static analysis tools regularly to catch regressions or new issues.

By following these steps methodically, you can reduce exposure to vulnerabilities and strengthen your application’s security posture
